# Internship-at-Pacco-LLC
In August 2023, I interned at a startup named Pacco LLC, where I was a Full-Stack Software Engineer. In this React Native Integration project, I used React Native Components and Navigation to create a user-friendly interface for customer and driver registration. In this program, users are navigated to the Welcome Screen, then prompted to either Customer or Driver Login. A new Account can be created through the registration UIâ€”inputting and validating several fields. These logins and registrations are appended to a MySQL Database that is integrated to the code. A Spring Boot REST API Service is set up in the backend, which the UI can access through Axios API calls. This project contains different languages, functions, and frameworks such as React Native, JavaScript, Node, Spring Boot, REST API, MySQL (and MySQL Workbench), Express, and Axios.
